# X Spec
This repository will hold X Improvement Proposals. Specifications for a decentralized social network.

### The problem with nostr and similar programs
- Built off relays segregating users, decreasing user experience
- If the network 1000x in users, the relays wouldn't be able to keep up from there centralized provider nature. growth == attack vector
- Messages aren't immutable if someone closes the relay you use your message history is gone
- Acts as a fancy form of IRC, architecture + segregation prevents the impact/reach Twitter has
- The need to add relays marginalizes non-technical users
- "Just find another relay bro" type culture. A blanket statement to solve all problems?

## Why is X better?
- Scalable
- Access to the whole network: 0 segregation
- No technical or setup needed by end users.
